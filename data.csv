In the case of ciprofloxacin, the narrowest range had the MSW-D1010 determined in the BM (1 to 8×MIC), while the MSW-D1010 determined in the AM was broader, ranging up to 4 mg/L (16×MIC), and the MSW-F1010 ranged up to 8 mg/L (32×MIC).","Mutant Prevention Concentration, Frequency of Spontaneous Mutant Selection, and Mutant Selection Window—a New Approach to the In Vitro Determination of the Antimicrobial Potency of Compounds","Krajewska J, Tyski S, Laudy AE.
